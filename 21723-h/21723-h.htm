<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p class="text">In collecting, arranging, editing, and preserving
the "Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow
Camp," my friend John Lomax has performed a
real service to American literature and to America.
No verse is closer to the soil than this; none more
realistic in the best sense of that much-abused word;
none more truly interprets and expresses a part of
our national life. To understand and appreciate
these lyrics one should hear Mr. Lomax talk about
them and sing them; for they were made for the
voice to pronounce and for the ears to hear, rather
than for the lamplit silence of the library. They
are as oral as the chants of Vachel Lindsay; and
when one has the pleasure of listening to Mr. Lomax &mdash; who
loves these verses and the men who first
sang them &mdash; one reconstructs in imagination the
appropriate figures and romantic setting.</p>

<p class="text">For nothing is so romantic as life itself. None
of our illusions about life is so romantic as the
truth. Hence the purest realism appeals to the
mature imagination more powerfully than any impossible
prettiness can do. The more we <i>know</i> of
individual and universal life, the more we are excited
and stimulated.</p>

<p class="text">And the collection of these poems is an addition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">p. viii</a></span>
to American Scholarship as well as to American Literature.
It was a wise policy of the Faculty of
Harvard University to grant Mr. Lomax a traveling
fellowship, that he might have the necessary
leisure to discover and to collect these verses; it is
really "original research," as interesting and surely
as valuable as much that passes under that name;
for it helps every one of us to understand our own
country.</p>

<p class="text">The "Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp"
does not purport to be an anthology of Western verse.
As its title indicates, the contents of the book are
limited to attempts, more or less poetic, in translating
scenes connected with the life of a cowboy. The
volume is in reality a by-product of my earlier collection,
"Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads."
In the former book I put together what
seemed to me to be the best of the songs created and
sung by the cowboys as they went about their work.
In making the collection, the cowboys often sang or
sent to me songs which I recognized as having already
been in print; although the singer usually said
that some other cowboy had sung the song to him
and that he did not know where it had originated.
For example, one night in New Mexico a cowboy
sang to me, in typical cowboy music, Larry Chitten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">p. x</a></span>den's
entire "Cowboys' Christmas Ball"; since that
time the poem has often come to me in manuscript
form as an original cowboy song. The changes &mdash; usually,
it must be confessed, resulting in bettering
the verse &mdash; which have occurred in oral transmission,
are most interesting. Of one example, Charles
Badger Clark's "High Chin Bob," I have printed,
following Mr. Clark's poem, a cowboy version,
which I submit to Mr. Clark and his admirers for
their consideration.</p>

<p class="text">In making selections for this volume from a large
mass of material that came into my ballad hopper
while hunting cowboy songs as a
<ins class="transcriber" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: original reads &#8216;Travelling&#8217;.">Traveling</ins> Fellow
from Harvard University, I have included the best
of the verse given me directly by the cowboys; other
selections have come in through repeated recommendation
of these men; others are vagrant verses from
Western newspapers; and still others have been
lifted from collections of Western verse written by
such men as Charles Badger Clark, Jr., and Herbert
H. Knibbs. To these two authors, as well as others
who have permitted me to make use of their work,
the grateful thanks of the collector are extended.
As will be seen, almost one-half of the selections
have no assignable authorship. I am equally grateful
to these unknown authors.</p>

<p class="text">All those who found "Cowboy Songs" diverting,
it is believed, will make welcome "The Songs of the
Cattle Trail and Cow Camp." Many of these have
this claim to be called songs: they have been set to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">p. xi</a></span>
music by the cowboys, who, in their isolation and
loneliness, have found solace in narrative or descriptive
verse devoted to cattle scenes. Herein,
again, through these quondam songs we may come
to appreciate something of the spirit of the big
West &mdash; its largeness, its freedom, its wholehearted
hospitality, its genuine friendship. Here again, too,
we may see the cowboy at work and at play; hear
the jingle of his big bell spurs, the swish of his rope,
the creaking of his saddle gear, the thud of thousands
of hoofs on the long, long trail winding from
Texas to Montana; and know something of the life
that attracted from the East some of its best young
blood to a work that was necessary in the winning
of the West. The trails are becoming dust covered
or grass grown or lost underneath the farmers' furrow;
but in the selections of this volume, many of
them poems by courtesy, men of today and those
who are to follow, may sense, at least in some small
measure, the service, the glamour, the romance of
that knight-errant of the plains &mdash; the American
cowboy.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">DID you ever wait for daylight when the stars along the river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floated thick and white as snowflakes in the water deep and strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till a whisper through the aspens made the current break and shiver<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the frosty edge of morning seemed to melt and spread and change?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Was about to wake my pardner who was sleeping close behind me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I saw the man we wanted spur his pony to the ford.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Saw the ripples of the shallows and the muddy streaks that followed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the pony stumbled toward me in the narrows of the bend;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But an oath had come between us &mdash; I was paid by Law and Order;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was outlaw, rustler, killer &mdash; so the border whisper ran;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left his word in Caliente that he'd cross the Rio border &mdash; <br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call me coward? But I hailed him &mdash; "Riding close to daylight, Dan!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Just a hair and he'd have got me, but my voice, and not the warning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught his hand and held him steady; then he nodded, spoke my name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reined his pony round and fanned it in the bright and silent morning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back across the sunlit Rio up the trail on which he came.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He had passed his word to cross it &mdash; I had passed my word to get him &mdash; <br /></span>
<span class="i0">We broke even and we knew it; 'twas a case of give and take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For old times. I could have killed him from the brush; instead, I let him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ride his trail &mdash; I turned &mdash; my pardner flung his arm and stretched awake;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">p. 4</a></span>

<span class="i0">Saw me standing in the open; pulled his gun and came beside me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asked a question with his shoulder as his left hand pointed toward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muddy streaks that thinned and vanished &mdash; not a word, but hard he eyed me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the water cleared and sparkled in the shallows of the ford.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">AT a round-up on the Gila<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One sweet morning long ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten of us was throwed quite freely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a hoss from Idaho.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' we 'lowed he'd go a-beggin'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a man to break his pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, a-hitchin' up one leggin',<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boastful Bill cut loose an' cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I'm a ornery proposition for to hurt,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I fulfil my earthly mission with a quirt,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I can ride the highest liver<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twixt the Gulf an' Powder River,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">An' I'll break this thing as easy as I'd flirt."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Bill climbed the Northern fury<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' they mangled up the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till a native of Missouri<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would have owned the brag was fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the plunges kept him reelin'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' the wind it flapped his shirt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud above the hoss's squealin'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We could hear our friend assert:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I'm the one to take such rockin's as a joke;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">p. 9</a></span>
<span class="i2">Someone hand me up the makin's of a smoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If you think my fame needs brightnin',<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why, I'll rope a streak o' lightnin'<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then one caper of repulsion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke that hoss's back in two,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cinches snapped in the convulsion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skyward man and saddle flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up they mounted, never flaggin',<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we watched them through our tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While this last, thin bit o' braggin'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came a-floatin' to our ears:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"If you ever watched my habits very close,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You would know I broke such rabbits by the gross.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I have kept my talent hidin',<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'm too good for earthly ridin',<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Years have passed since that ascension;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the night wind flaps our slickers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rain is cold and stout,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Hey, you earthlin's, shut your winders,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We're a-rippin' clouds to flinders.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If this blue-eyed darlin' kicks at you, you die."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Star-dust on his chaps and saddle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scornful still of jar and jolt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'll come back sometime a-straddle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a bald-faced thunderbolt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thin-skinned generation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that dim and distant day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure will stare with admiration<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they hear old Boastful say:<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I THINK we can all remember when a Greaser hadn't no show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Palo Pinto particular,&mdash; it ain't very long ago;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A powerful feelin' of hatred ag'in the whole Greaser race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That murdered bold Crockett and Bowie pervaded all in the place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, the boys would draw on a Greaser as quick as they would on a steer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They was shot down without warnin' often, in the memory of many here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One day the bark of pistols was heard ringin' out in the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a Greaser, chased by some ranchmen, tore round here into the square.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don't know what he's committed,&mdash;'tain't likely anyone knew,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I wouldn't bet a check on the issue; if you knew the gang, neither would you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathless and bleeding, the Greaser fell down by the side of the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a man sprang out before him,&mdash; a man both strong and tall,&mdash; <br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his clothes I should say a cowboy,&mdash; a stranger in town, I think,&mdash; <br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">p. 12</a></span>
<span class="i0">With his pistol he waved back the gang, who was wild with rage and drink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I warn ye, get back!" he said, "or I'll blow your heads in two!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dozen on one poor creature, and him wounded and bleeding, too!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gang stood back for a minute; then up spoke Poker Bill:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Young man, yer a stranger, I reckon. We don't wish yer any ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But come out of the range of the Greaser, or, as sure as I live, you'll croak;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he drew a bead on the stranger. I'll tell yer it wa'n't no joke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the stranger moven' no muscle as he looked in the bore of Bill's gun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hadn't no thought to stir, sir; he hadn't no thought to run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he spoke out cool and quiet, "I might live for a thousand year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not die at last so nobly as defendin' this Greaser here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he's wounded, now, and helpless, and hasn't had no fair show;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the first of ye boys that strikes him, I'll lay that first one low."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gang respected the stranger that for another was willing to die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They respected the look of daring they saw in that cold, blue eye.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">p. 13</a></span>
<span class="i0">They saw before them a hero that was glad in the right to fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he was a Texas cowboy,&mdash; never heard of Rome at all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't tell me of yer Romans, or yer bridge bein' held by three;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True manhood's the same in Texas as it was in Rome, d'ye see?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did the Greaser escape? Why certain. I saw the hull crowd over thar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the ranch of Bill Simmons, the gopher, with their glasses over the bar.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">THE first that we saw of the high-tone tramp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War over thar at our Pecos camp;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He war comin' down the Santa Fe trail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Astride of a wheel with a crooked tail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-skinnin' along with a merry song<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He looked so outlandish, strange and queer<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He never seed sich a hoss before.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Be kicked in the neck if I ever seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sich a saddle as that on his queer machine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, it made us laugh, fer it wasn't half<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Big enough fer the back of a suckin' calf.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That, providin' the enterprize would pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought as I might jes' happen to light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a hoss that would leave him out er sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In less'n a second we seen him yank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A roll o' greenbacks out o' his flank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' he said if we wanted to bet, to name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The limit, an' he would tackle the game.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jes' a week before we had all been down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a jamboree to the nearest town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' the whiskey joints and the faro games<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' a-shakin' our hoofs with the dance hall dames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made a wholesale bust; an', pard, I'll be cussed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If a man in the outfit had any dust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' so I explained, but the youth replied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he'd lay the money matter aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' to show that his back didn't grow no moss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd bet his machine against my hoss.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I tuk him up, an' the bet war closed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">An' the boys chipped in with a knowin' grin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fer they thought the fool had no chance to win.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' so we agreed fer to run that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Navajo cross, ten miles away,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As handsome a track as you ever seed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While Mexican Bart and big Jim Hart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stayed back fer to give us an even start.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I got aboard of my broncho bird<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To see that tenderfoot drop to the rear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The first three miles slipped away first-rate;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With tenderfoot more'n a mile behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I jogged along with a cowboy song<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Ting, ting, ting, ting,</i>&mdash; too infernal near;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of a tenderfoot gainin' every jump.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I hit old bronc a cut with the quirt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' once more got him to scratchin' dirt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his wind got weak, an' I tell you, boss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seen he wasn't no ten-mile hoss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still, the plucky brute took another shoot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' pulled away from the wheel galoot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the animal couldn't hold his gait;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' the idea somehow entered my pate<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">p. 17</a></span>
<span class="i0">That if tenderfoot's legs didn't lose their grip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd own that hoss at the end of the trip.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Closer an' closer come tenderfoot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' harder the whip to the hoss I put;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the Eastern cuss, with a smile on his face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran up to my side with his easy pace &mdash; <br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode up to my side, an' dern his hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remarked 'twere a pleasant day fer a ride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then axed, onconcerned, if I had a match,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' on his britches give it a scratch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lit a cigarette, said he wished me good-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' as fresh as a daisy scooted away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ahead he went, that infernal gong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-ringin' "good-day" as he flew along,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like a vaporous snicker along his track.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On an' on he sped, gettin' further ahead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His feet keepin' up that onceaseable tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he faded away in the distance, an' when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seed the condemned Eastern rooster again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He war thar with the boys at the end of the race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That same keerless, onconsarned smile on his face.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, pard, when a cowboy gits licked he don't swar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor kick, if the beatin' are done on the squar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I tuck that Easterner right by the hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' told him that broncho awaited his brand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I axed him his name, an' where from he came,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">p. 18</a></span>
<span class="i0">An' how long he'd practiced that wheel-rollin' game.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From a town they call Bosting, in old Yankeedom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he jist paralyzed us by sayin' he'd whirled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That very identical wheel round the world.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wal, pard, that's the story of how that smart chap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Done me up w'en I thought I had sich a soft snap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Done me up on a race with remarkable ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' lowered my pride a good many degrees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did I give him the hoss? W'y o' course I did, boss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' I tell you it warn't no diminutive loss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He writ me a letter from back in the East,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' said he presented the neat little beast<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">SHE was a Texas maiden, she came of low degree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her clothes were worn and faded, her feet from shoes were free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her face was tanned and freckled, her hair was sun-burned, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her whole darned <i>tout ensemble</i> was painful for to view!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She drove a lop-eared mule team attached unto a plow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trickling perspiration exuding from her brow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often she lamented her cruel, cruel fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As but a po' white's daughter down in the Lone Star State.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No courtiers came to woo her, she never had a beau,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her misfit face precluded such things as that, you know,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was nobody's darling, no feller's solid girl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poets never called her an uncut Texas pearl.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her only two companions was those two flea-bit mules,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these she but regarded as animated tools<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To plod along the furrows in patience up and down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pull the ancient wagon when pap'd go to town.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">p. 28</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No fires of wild ambition were flaming in her soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes with tender passion she'd never upward roll;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wondrous world she'd heard of, to her was but a dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As walked she in the furrows behind that lop-eared team.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born on that small plantation, 'twas there she thought she'd die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She never longed for pinions that she might rise and fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To other lands far distant, where breezes fresh and cool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would never shake and tremble from brayings of a mule.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But yesterday we saw her dressed up in gorgeous style!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A half a dozen fellows were basking in her smile!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She'd jewels on her fingers, and jewels in her ears &mdash; <br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great sparkling, flashing brilliants that hung as frozen tears!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feet once nude and soil-stained were clad in Frenchy boots,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The once tanned face bore tintings of miscellaneous fruits;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice that once admonished the mules to move along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was tuned to new-born music, as sweet as Siren's song!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Each in the hope that some day he'll call him dad-in-law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their days of toil are over, their sun has risen at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gold-embroidered curtain now hides their rocky past;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Had rested there for ages above a flow of oil?<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">IT was on the western frontier,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The miners, rugged and brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were gathered round the posters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The circus had come to town!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great tent shone in the darkness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a wonderful palace of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rough men crowded the entrance,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shows didn't come every night!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not a woman's face among them;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a face that was bad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some that were only vacant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some that were very sad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And behind a canvas curtain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a corner of the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clown, with chalk and vermillion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was "making up" his face.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A weary looking woman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a smile that still was sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sewed on a little garment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a cradle at her feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pantaloon stood ready and waiting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was time for the going on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the clown in vain searched wildly,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The "property baby" was gone!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">p. 41</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He murmured, impatiently hunting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It's strange that I cannot find &mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, I've looked in every corner;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It must have been left behind!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The miners were stamping and shouting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were not patient men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clown bent over the cradle,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I must take you, little Ben."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mother started and shivered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But trouble and want were near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She lifted the baby gently,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You'll be very careful, dear?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Careful? You foolish darling!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How tenderly it was said!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What a smile shone through the chalk and paint!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I love each hair of his head!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The noise rose into an uproar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Misrule for the time was king;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clown with a foolish chuckle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bolted into the ring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as, with a squeak and flourish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fiddles closed their tune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You'll hold him as if he were made of glass?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said the clown to the pantaloon.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The jovial fellow nodded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I've a couple myself," he said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I know how to handle 'em, bless you!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">p. 42</a></span>
<span class="i0">Old fellow, go ahead!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fun grew fast and furious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not one of all the crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had guessed that the baby was alive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he suddenly laughed aloud.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, that baby laugh! It was echoed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the benches with a ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the roughest customer there sprang up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With, "Boys, it's the real thing."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ring was jammed in a minute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a man that did not strive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a "shot at holding the baby,"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The baby that was alive!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He was thronged with kneeling suitors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the midst of the dusty ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he held his court right royally,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair little baby king,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till one of the shouting courtiers,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man with a bold, hard face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The talk, for miles, of the country,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the terror of the place,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Raised the little king to his shoulder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chuckled, "Look at that!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the chubby fingers clutched his hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, "Boys, hand round the hat!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There never was such a hatful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of silver and gold and notes;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">p. 43</a></span>
<span class="i0">People are not always penniless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because they don't wear coats.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then, "Three cheers for the baby!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tell you those cheers were meant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the way that they were given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was enough to raise the tent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then there was sudden silence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a gruff old miner said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Come boys, enough of this rumpus;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's time it was put to bed."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, looking a little sheepish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with faces strangely bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The audience, somewhat lingering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flocked out into the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bold-faced leader chuckled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He wasn't a bit afraid!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's as game as he's good-looking!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boys, that was a show that <i>paid!</i>"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And punched up the drags on the old Chisholm Trail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the world was all bright and the girls were all pretty,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then here's to the eyes that like diamonds are gleaming,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And here's to the night we shall ever recall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here's to the time &mdash; time shall know not its equal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we danced the day in at the Cattlemen's Ball.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">FROM every point they gaily come, the broncho's unshod feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pat at the green sod of the range with quick, emphatic beat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tresses of the buxom girls as banners stream behind &mdash; <br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like silken, castigating whips cut at the sweeping wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dashing cowboys, brown of face, sit in their saddle thrones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sing the wild songs of the range in free, uncultured tones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ride beside the pretty girls, like gallant cavaliers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pour the usual fairy tales into their list'ning ears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the "best room" of the ranch the jolly gathered throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buzz like a hive of human bees and lade the air with song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maidens tap their sweetest smiles and give their tongues full rein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In efforts to entrap the boys in admiration's chain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fiddler tunes the strings with pick of thumb and scrape of bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finds one string keyed a note too high, another one too low;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">p. 118</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then rosins up the tight-drawn hairs, the young folks in a fret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until their ears are greeted with the warning words, "All set!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">S'lute yer pardners! Let 'er go!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Balance all an' do-ce-do!<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Swing yer op'sites! Swing agin!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Kiss the sagehens if you kin!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' thus the merry dance went on till morning's struggling light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In lengthening streaks of grey breaks down the barriers of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And broncs are mounted in the glow of early morning skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By weary-limbed young revelers with drooping, sleepy eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cowboys to the ranges speed to "work" the lowing herds,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">p. 119</a></span>
<span class="i0">The girls within their chambers hide their sleep like weary birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for a week the young folks talk of what a jolly spree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had that night at Jackson's ranch down on the Owyhee.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">HE wears a big hat and big spurs and all that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leggins of fancy fringed leather;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He takes pride in his boots and the pistol he shoots,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he's happy in all kinds of weather;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's fond of his horse, it's a broncho, of course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For oh, he can ride like the devil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is old for his years and he always appears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a fellow who's lived on the level;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He can sing, he can cook, yet his eyes have the look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a man that to fear is a stranger;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, his cool, quiet nerve will always subserve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his wild life of duty and danger.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gets little to eat, and he guys tenderfeet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for fashion, oh well! he's not in it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He can rope a gay steer when he gets on its ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the rate of two-forty a minute;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His saddle's the best in the wild, woolly West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes it will cost sixty dollars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, he knows all the tricks when he brands mavericks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his knowledge is not got from your scholars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is loyal as steel, but demands a square deal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he hates and despises a coward;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the cowboy, you'll find, to women is kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he'll fight till by death overpowered.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">p. 128</a></span>
<span class="i0">Hence I say unto you,&mdash; give the cowboy his due<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be kind, my friends, to his folly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he's generous and brave though he may not behave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like your dudes, who are so melancholy.<br /></span>

<h3><a name="A_RANGER" id="A_RANGER"></a>A RANGER</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">HE never made parade of tooth or claw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was plain as us that nursed the bawlin' herds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he had a rather meanin'-lookin' jaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was shy of exercisin' it with words.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a circus-ridin' preacher of the law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All his preachin' was the sort that hit the nail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was just a common ranger, just a ridin' pilgrim stranger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he labored with the sinners of the trail.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once a Yaqui knifed a woman, jealous mad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hit southward with the old, old killer's plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nobody missed the woman very bad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While they'd just a little rather missed the man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the ranger crossed his trail and sniffed it glad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then loped away to bring him back again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he stood for peace and order on the lonely, sunny border<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his business was to hunt for sinful men!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the trail it led him southward all the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the shinin' country of the thorn and snake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the heat had drove the lizards from their play<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">p. 135</a></span>
<span class="i0">To the shade of rock and bush and yucca stake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mountains heaved and rippled far away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the desert broiled as on the devil's prong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he didn't mind the devil if his head kept clear and level<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hoofs beat out their clear and steady song.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Came the yellow west, and on a far off rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something black crawled up and dropped beyond the rim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he reached his rifle out and rubbed his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While he cussed the southern hills for growin' dim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down a hazy 'royo came the coyote cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like they laughed at him because he'd lost his mark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the smile that brands a fighter pulled his mouth a little tighter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he set his spurs and rode on through the dark.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Came the moonlight on a trail that wriggled higher<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the mountains that look into Mexico,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the shadows strung his nerves like banjo wire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the miles and minutes dragged unearthly slow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a black mesquite spit out a thread of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the canyon walls flung thunder back again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he caught himself and fumbled at his rifle while he grumbled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his bridle arm had weight enough for ten.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though his rifle pointed wavy-like and slack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he grabbed for leather at his hawse's shy,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">p. 136</a></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he sent a soft-nosed exhortation back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That convinced the sinner &mdash; just above the eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the sinner sprawled among the shadows black<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the ranger drifted north beneath the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wabblin' crazy in his saddle, workin' hard to stay a-straddle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the hoofs beat out a slow and sorry tune.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the sheriff got up early out of bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he stared and vowed his soul a total loss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he saw the droopy thing all blotched with red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That came ridin' in aboard a tremblin' hawse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But "I got 'im" was the most the ranger said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you couldn't hire him, now, to tell the tale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was just a quiet ranger, just a ridin' pilgrim stranger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he labored with the sinners of the trail.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'TWAS the lean coyote told me, baring his slavish soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As I counted the ribs of my dead cayuse and cursed at the desert sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tale of the Upland Rider's fate while I dug in the water hole<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For a drop, a taste of the bitter seep; but the water hole was dry!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"He came," said the lean coyote, "and he cursed as his pony fell;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Shriveled with thirst for a thousand years and craving a drop &mdash; just one."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His name?" I asked, and he told me, yawning to hide a grin:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"His name is writ on the prison roll and many a place beside;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But one of the crazy shots went home and silenced the waiting beast;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There lay the shape of the Liar, dead! 'Twas I that should laugh the last.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Laugh? Nay, now I would write my name as the Upland Rider wrote;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Write? What need, for before my eyes in a wide and wavering line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the trace of a written word and letter by letter float<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Into a mist as the world grew dark; and I knew that the name was mine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dreams and visions within the dream; turmoil and fire and pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hands that proffered a brimming cup &mdash; empty, ere I could take;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the burst of a thunder-head &mdash; rain! It was rude, fierce rain!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Blindly down to the hole I crept, shivering, drenched, awake!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oh, to hear once more the clanking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the noisy cowboy's spur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the south wind's kiss like a mild caress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making the grasses stir.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And oh, for a night in the open<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where no sound discordant mars,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The call of the plains again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The call of the Spirit of Freedom<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">HERE'S to the passing cowboy, the plowman's pioneer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His home, the boundless mesa, he of any man the peer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around his wide sombrero was stretched the rattler's hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bridle sporting conchos, his lasso at his side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day he roamed the prairies, at night he, with the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept vigil o'er thousands held by neither posts nor bars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With never a diversion in all the lonesome land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But cattle, cattle, cattle, and sun and sage and sand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sometimes the hoot-owl hailed him, when scudding through the flat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prairie dogs would sauce him, as at their doors they sat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rattler hissed its warning when near its haunts he trod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some Texas steer pursuing o'er the pathless waste of sod.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lasso, quirt, and 'colter the cowboy knew his skill;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But cattle, cattle, cattle, and sun and sand and sage.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And oh! the long night watches, with terror in the skies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lightning played and mocked him till blinded were his eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When raged the storm around him, and fear was in his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest panic-stricken leaders might make the whole herd start.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That meant a death for many, perhaps a wild stampede,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When none could stem the fury of the cattle in the lead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, then life seemed so little and death so very near,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cattle, cattle, cattle, and darkness everywhere.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then quaff with me a bumper of water, clear and pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the memory of the cowboy whose fame must e'er endure<br /></span>

<span class="i0">HE reached the West in a palace car where the writers tell us the cowboys are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the redskin bold and the centipede and the rattlesnake and the loco weed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He looked around for the Buckskin Joes and the things he'd seen in the Wild West shows &mdash; <br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cowgirls gay and the bronchos wild and the painted face of the Injun child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He listened close for the fierce war-whoop, and his pent-up spirits began to droop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he wondered then if the hills and nooks held none of the sights of the story books.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He'd hoped he would see the marshal pot some bold bad man with a pistol shot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And entered a low saloon by chance, where the tenderfoot is supposed to dance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the cowboy shoots at his bootheels there and the smoke of powder begrims the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all was quiet as if he'd strayed to that silent spot where the dead are laid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not even a faro game was seen, and none flaunted the long, long green.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the cowboy's yell as he roped a steer, but nothing of this fell on his ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not even a wide-brimmed hat he spied, but derbies flourished on every side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the spurs and the "chaps" and the flannel shirts, the high-heeled boots and the guns and the quirts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cowboy saddles and silver bits and fancy bridles and swell outfits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd read about in the novels grim, were not on hand for the likes of him.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And a burro train with its pack-loads which he'd read they tie with the diamond hitch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rattler's whir and the coyote's wail ne'er sounded out as he hit the trail;<br /></span>
